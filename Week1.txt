I familiarized myself with our project proposal and went through the introduction presentation by Saratoga National Cemetery. 

I discussed with our client about my plan and design principles of this website. I also found 3 other similar websites as the design reference and analyzed them in terms of UI and functionality with my group partners.

I set up my personal wordpress website to familiarize myself with all the features provided and have a basic understanding about the tool we're using to finish this project.
